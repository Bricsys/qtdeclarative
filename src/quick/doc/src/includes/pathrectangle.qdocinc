//! [radius-property]
\qmlproperty real \1::radius

This property defines the corner radius used to define a rounded rectangle.

If radius is a positive value, the rectangle path will be defined as a rounded rectangle,
otherwise it will be defined as a normal rectangle.

This property may be overridden by the individual corner radius properties.

\sa topLeftRadius, topRightRadius, bottomLeftRadius, bottomRightRadius
//! [radius-property]


//! [radius-properties]
\qmlproperty real \1::topLeftRadius
\qmlproperty real \1::topRightRadius
\qmlproperty real \1::bottomLeftRadius
\qmlproperty real \1::bottomRightRadius

If set, these properties define the individual corner radii. A zero value defines that corner
to be sharp, while a positive value defines it to be rounded. When unset, the value of \l
radius is used instead.

These properties are unset by default. Assign \c undefined to them to return them to the unset
state.

In the following example, \l radius is set to \c 10, and \c topLeftRadius to \c 0:

\sa radius
//! [radius-properties]


//! [bevel-property]
\qmlproperty bool \1::bevel

This property defines whether the corners of the rectangle are beveled.

Setting it to \c false results in either sharp or rounded corners,
depending on the values of the individual \l radius properties.

This property may be overridden by the individual bevel properties.

//! [bevel-properties]
\qmlproperty bool \1::topLeftBevel
\qmlproperty bool \1::topRightBevel
\qmlproperty bool \1::bottomLeftBevel
\qmlproperty bool \1::bottomRightBevel

If set, these properties define the individual corner bevels. Setting them
to \c false results in either sharp or rounded corners, depending on the
values of the individual \l radius properties. Setting them to \c true
results in bevelled corners. When unset, the value of \l bevel is used
instead.

These properties are unset by default. Assign \c undefined to them to
return them to the unset state.

In the following example, \c bottomRightBevel is set to true:
